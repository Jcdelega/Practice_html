    <p>The course of frontend developer has been quite interesting for me, because I've been learning lots of new things as the time passes by, I've been felt comfortable and cozy by the course, most of the time because I came form an engineering and I think that hepls you a lot when you embark yourself in a new path related with the field, indeed if you know some basis of programming you can learn quickly. Of course you need to practice if you wan to master on something, and that's what I'm going to do. I must admit at the beginig It was bit boring, but when we started with the practice It was more entertaining.</p>
